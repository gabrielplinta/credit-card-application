# Credit Card Application


## ðŸŽ¯ About
This application was developed when I was doing the Alura Course of Java OOP. 
The application has the goal of simulate a credit card behaviour when doing purchases and its statement.
It allows the user to keep adding purchases to a certain limit. After the user finishes the application,
it displays all the purchases made in a list in descending order. 


## ðŸš€ Project Details

* The user is prompted to define a limit for this credit card.
* A While Loop will enter and the User will have the option to add a purchase (1) or exit the program (0)
* To capture the User's choice a switch case is used:
  * 1 - The user can add purchases only if there is still limit on the Credit Card. If the purchase is confirmed, its details will be saved on a list of Purchases.
  * 0 - Program is exited
* After the User exits the Program, the list that contains all the purchases will be sorted and displayed in descending order.
* All Purchases and the final balance of the Credit Card are printed
